# Welcome to FaceUp Backend exercise ðŸ’™!

Dear candidate,

Welcome to the backend developer assignment. This task consists of 4 parts,
estimated at around 2-3 hours of work.

Right from the very start, we encourage you to use AI as you wish. Some of the work that is required here can be done very efficiently using AI, and being efficient is what we want from ourselves and our colleagues.

Just bear in mind that you'll be __asked to briefly explain everything you have submitted__ (and we can be *quite nit-picky* if we see that you don't understand something that was generated).

## What we want from you
In this template, you will find four subfolders, each for its respective part:
- `/domain` - testing how you can structure code
- `/api` - testing if you know what a good api design is
- `/sql` - testing if you know what a good relational database design is
- `/solving` - testing your problem-solving skills in unusual circumstances

In each of these, you will find the `README.md` file with instructions. In the end, please send us a __link of your fork of this repo__, with your files completed.

## What we dont want from you
- __DO NOT__ change the uppermost directory structure. It will make our lifes much harder when validating your work.
- __DO NOT__ take this as a project. We only want the things which are specified. This should be a matter of creating one sql script, one swagger config, one karel script and few files in the domain logic. No one wants any ORM stuff, libraries, etc.

## How we want it
Please, pretty please, __focus on the ideas first__. There are a lot of people that can glue together a BE application. We are looking for the ones, who can make it reasonable.
Generally, it is not about what have you done, but how do you do it and why have you made the
decisions that you have made.

## Tips and tricks
- Commit well and commit often. It's a great practice, and we will be delighted to review tidy commits.
- Make notes of your decisions. It will be easier to explain afterward.
- Think, then code, then refine.
- Format and lint stuff.
- If you don't understand something or you have found a problem with the assignment, message us.
- `/sql`, `/domain` and `/api` share one scenario. Make your solutions play together.
